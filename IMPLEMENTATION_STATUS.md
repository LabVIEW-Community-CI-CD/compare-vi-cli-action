# Self-Hosted Windows Implementation Status

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation status of self-hosted Windows runner support for the LabVIEW Compare VI CLI GitHub Action.

## ✅ Completed Features

### Core Functionality

- **Strict Canonical CLI Path Resolution**: Implemented in `scripts/CompareVI.ps1`
  - Only accepts: `C:\Program Files\National Instruments\Shared\LabVIEW Compare\LVCompare.exe`
  - Rejects any other path (via `lvComparePath` input or `LVCOMPARE_PATH` env)
  - No PATH probing or alternative search locations
  - Ensures consistency across all self-hosted runners

- **Comprehensive Error Handling**:
  - Validates required inputs
  - Resolves relative paths from `working-directory`
  - Emits outputs before failures for workflow branching
  - Structured step summaries via `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`

- **PR-Triggered Self-Hosted Testing**:
  - Integration tests run on self-hosted Windows runners when PR labeled with `test-integration`
  - Smoke tests run on self-hosted Windows runners when PR labeled with `smoke`
  - Provides test coverage validation before merge

### Testing Infrastructure

#### Test Dispatchers

**Local Dispatcher (`tools/Run-Pester.ps1`)**:

- Used by GitHub-hosted workflows and manual local testing
- Handles Pester module discovery and installation
- Supports `IncludeIntegration` switch parameter
- Used by `test-pester.yml` and `pester-integration-on-label.yml`

**Root Dispatcher (`Invoke-PesterTests.ps1`)**:

- Entry point for self-hosted runner test execution
- Called directly by `pester-selfhosted.yml` workflow
- Assumes Pester v5+ is pre-installed on self-hosted runner
- Parameters: `TestsPath`, `IncludeIntegration`, `ResultsPath`
- Generates NUnit XML and summary text files

#### Unit Tests (`tests/CompareVI.Tests.ps1`, `tests/CompareVI.InputOutput.Tests.ps1`)

- ✅ 23 tests total, 20 passing, 3 skipped (require canonical CLI on Windows)
- Mock-based testing without requiring real CLI
- Test all resolution paths and error conditions
- Run on `windows-latest` GitHub-hosted runners
- **New**: Canonical path fallback test (skipped when CLI not installed)

#### Integration Tests (`tests/CompareVI.Integration.Tests.ps1`)

- Tagged with `Integration` for conditional execution
- Require self-hosted Windows runner with:
  - LabVIEW Compare CLI at canonical path
  - `LV_BASE_VI` and `LV_HEAD_VI` environment variables
  - (Optional) LabVIEWCLI for HTML report generation tests
- Validate real CLI invocation and exit codes
- **Improved error messages**: Provide setup instructions when environment is misconfigured
- **Knowledgebase integration**: Tests for recommended CLI flags
  - `-nobdcosm` - Ignore block diagram cosmetic changes
  - `-nofppos` - Ignore front panel position changes
  - `-noattr` - Ignore VI attribute changes
  - `-lvpath` - LabVIEW version selection
  - Complex flag combinations
- **LabVIEWCLI HTML Report Tests**: Comprehensive testing of HTML comparison report generation
  - Tests `CreateComparisonReport` operation from knowledgebase
  - Validates noise filter flags with HTML output
  - Tests identical VIs (no differences scenario)
  - Validates handling of paths with spaces
  - All LabVIEWCLI tests automatically skipped if LabVIEWCLI.exe not available

#### Mock CLI Tests (`.github/workflows/test-mock.yml`) - DEPRECATED

- **NOTE**: This workflow is deprecated with the canonical-only CLI path policy
- Unit tests provide sufficient mock-based coverage via function-level mocking
- Kept for manual dispatch only for backward compatibility
- Use `test-pester.yml` for mock-based testing instead

### Workflows

#### `test-pester.yml` - Unit Tests

- Runs on `windows-latest`
- Excludes Integration tests by default
- Can include Integration via workflow_dispatch input

#### `pester-selfhosted.yml` - Self-Hosted Integration Tests

- Runs on `[self-hosted, Windows, X64]`
- Uses repository variables `LV_BASE_VI` and `LV_HEAD_VI`
- Includes Integration tests by default
- Uploads test results as artifacts
- Manual dispatch only (workflow_dispatch)
- **Calls dispatcher directly**: Invokes `Invoke-PesterTests.ps1` at repository root
- **Test Dispatcher**: Self-contained test execution
  - Assumes Pester v5+ is pre-installed on self-hosted runner
  - Accepts `TestsPath`, `IncludeIntegration`, and `ResultsPath` parameters
  - No external action dependencies

#### `pester-integration-on-label.yml` - PR Integration Tests

- Runs on `[self-hosted, Windows, X64]` when PR is labeled with `test-integration`
- Automatically triggered on PR events (labeled, reopened, synchronize)
- Runs full Pester integration suite including real CLI tests
- Posts results as PR comment
- Uploads test results as artifacts
- **Environment validation**: Checks for CLI and VI files before running tests

#### `test-mock.yml` - Mock CLI Validation

- Runs on `windows-latest`
- Tests action behavior without real CLI
- Validates all code paths
- Generates and uploads HTML reports

#### `command-dispatch.yml` - PR Comment Commands

- Responds to PR comments starting with `/run`
- Supports commands:
  - `/run unit` - Unit tests only
  - `/run mock` - Mock CLI tests
  - `/run smoke` - Smoke tests on self-hosted runner
  - `/run pester-selfhosted` - Integration tests on self-hosted runner
- Parses command-line style arguments
- Dispatches workflows on PR head branch (same-repo) or main (fork)

#### `smoke.yml` - Manual Smoke Tests

- Manual dispatch workflow
- Runs on self-hosted Windows runner
- Accepts VI file paths as inputs
- Generates HTML comparison reports

#### `smoke-on-label.yml` - PR Smoke Tests

- Runs on `[self-hosted, Windows, X64]` when PR is labeled with `smoke`
- Automatically triggered on PR events (labeled, reopened, synchronize)
- Uses repository variables for VI file paths
- Posts results as PR comment
- **Environment validation**: Checks for CLI before running tests

#### `validate.yml` - Linting and Validation

- Runs markdownlint on all Markdown files
- Runs actionlint on all workflow files
- Executes on every PR and push to main

## Self-Hosted Runner Requirements

### Software

- Windows Server or Windows 10/11
- LabVIEW 2025 Q3 with valid license
- LabVIEW Compare CLI installed at canonical path:
  - `C:\Program Files\National Instruments\Shared\LabVIEW Compare\LVCompare.exe`
- PowerShell 7+ (pwsh)

### Configuration

1. Install GitHub Actions runner
2. Run as service under account with LabVIEW license
3. Add runner labels: `self-hosted`, `Windows`, `X64`
4. Set repository variables:
   - `LV_BASE_VI` - Path to a test VI file
   - `LV_HEAD_VI` - Path to a different test VI file

### Testing the Setup

1. Manually dispatch `pester-selfhosted.yml` workflow
2. Verify all Integration tests pass
3. Use PR comment `/run pester-selfhosted` to test from PRs
4. Add label `test-integration` to PRs to run integration tests automatically
5. Add label `smoke` to PRs to run smoke tests automatically

## CI/CD Pipeline

### On Pull Request

1. Validate (markdownlint, actionlint)
2. Unit tests (windows-latest)
3. **Optional:** Integration tests (self-hosted, when labeled with `test-integration`)
4. **Optional:** Smoke tests (self-hosted, when labeled with `smoke`)

### On PR Comment

- `/run unit` - Quick unit test feedback
- `/run mock` - Mock CLI validation (deprecated, use unit tests instead)
- `/run pester-selfhosted` - Full integration testing
- `/run smoke pr=NUMBER` - Manual smoke test

### On Push to Main

1. Validate
2. Unit tests

### On Tag Push (vX.Y.Z)

1. Create GitHub Release
2. Extract changelog section
3. Publish to GitHub Marketplace

## Known Limitations

- Integration tests require self-hosted Windows runner (not available on GitHub-hosted)
- Real CLI requires LabVIEW license and installation
- Mock CLI provides limited validation compared to real CLI
- Actionlint reports shellcheck style warnings (info level, not failures)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for consideration:

- Add support for LabVIEW versions other than 2025 Q3
- Enhanced HTML report generation with diff visualization
- Performance benchmarking for large VI files
- Parallel test execution for faster CI feedback
- Automated runner health checks
