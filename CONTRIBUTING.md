# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to `compare-vi-cli-action`!

## Prerequisites

- Self-hosted Windows runner with LabVIEW 2025 Q3 installed and licensed
- Ability to provide LVCompare path via PATH, `LVCOMPARE_PATH`, or `lvComparePath`

## Getting Started

- Fork and clone the repo
- Create a feature branch
- Use the smoke test workflow (`.github/workflows/smoke.yml`) to validate changes against sample `.vi` files on your self-hosted runner

## Action Development Tips

- The action is composite with `pwsh` steps; prefer small changes and test incrementally
- Exit code mapping: 0 = no diff, 1 = diff; any other exit code should fail fast (outputs preserved)
- Full CLI flags are passed through `lvCompareArgs` (quotes supported)
- You can set `working-directory` to control relative path resolution for `base` and `head`

## Documentation

We use a multi-document strategy for comprehensive coverage:

- **README.md** - Quick start and basic usage (keep focused, ~600 lines max)
- **docs/USAGE_GUIDE.md** - Advanced configuration and recipes
- **docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md** - Testing, building, and release process
- **docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Common issues and solutions
- **docs/COMPARE_LOOP_MODULE.md** - Loop mode details
- **docs/INTEGRATION_TESTS.md** - Test prerequisites and setup
- **docs/TESTING_PATTERNS.md** - Advanced test design patterns

### Documentation Guidelines

- Keep README focused on getting started quickly; move details to topic-specific guides
- Cross-link between documents for easy navigation
- When adding new features, update relevant guide documents
- Keep examples copy-paste friendly and accurate
- Document breaking changes prominently in README and CHANGELOG

## Style and Validation

- PRs run markdownlint and actionlint via `.github/workflows/validate.yml`
- Run `.github/workflows/test-mock.yml` on PRs (windows-latest); use smoke on self-hosted for real LVCompare
- Keep README examples accurate and executable

## Testing

See the [Developer Guide](./docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for comprehensive testing information including:

- Running unit tests
- Running integration tests
- Test dispatcher architecture
- Continuous development workflow

Quick commands:

```powershell
# Unit tests only
./Invoke-PesterTests.ps1

# Integration tests (requires LVCompare)
$env:LV_BASE_VI = 'VI1.vi'
$env:LV_HEAD_VI = 'VI2.vi'
./Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -IncludeIntegration true
```

## Branch Protection (Maintainers)

1) In repository settings → Branches → Add rule for `main`
2) Require status checks to pass before merging:
   - `Validate`
   - `Test (mock)`
3) Optionally require linear history and dismiss stale approvals

## Repository Topics (Maintainers)

- Add topics for discoverability: `labview`, `lvcompare`, `vi`, `composite-action`, `windows`, `github-actions`

## Marketplace Listing (Maintainers)

- Ensure `action.yml` `name`, `description`, and `branding` are correct (icon: `git-merge`, color: `blue`)
- Publish the repository to GitHub Marketplace
- Update `README.md` with a Marketplace link after publication

## Releases

- Tag semantic versions (e.g., `v0.1.0`); the release workflow reads `CHANGELOG.md` to generate release notes
- After tagging, ensure README examples reference the latest stable tag

## Maintainers

- CODEOWNERS: `@svelderrainruiz`

## Documentation Style

Markdown lint configuration intentionally disables the MD013 (line length) rule globally.
Rationale:

- Technical tables, JSON fragments, and schema / command examples often exceed 160 chars and wrapping them reduces readability.
- Large refactor risk: historical sections (dispatcher notes, loop mode tuning) rely on long inline code spans.

Guidelines:

- Prefer wrapping narrative paragraphs to a reasonable width (~120–160) for new content, but do not hard-wrap within embedded JSON, PowerShell code fences, or tables.
- Break up extremely long explanatory list items (>220 chars) unless doing so fragments a schema or command.
- Use concise language; remove redundant qualifiers (e.g., "in order to" → "to").
- Keep bullet introductions on their own line before long wrapped sub-lines for scanability.

When a single long line is clearer (e.g., a one-line JSON example), keep it—no inline disable needed since MD013 is off.

If we later re-enable MD013:

1. Reintroduce a `"MD013": { "line_length": 160 }` block in `.markdownlint.jsonc`.
2. Add per-line opt-outs using `<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD013 -->` above intentional long lines.
3. Avoid splitting code spans across lines solely for lint; prefer disabling for that line.

Always ensure examples remain copy/paste friendly (avoid trailing spaces, stray prompts inside code blocks).
