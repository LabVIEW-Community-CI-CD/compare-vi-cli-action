# CLI-only session artifacts

This directory captures example outputs from a LabVIEW CLI-only compare run so schema validation
and documentation walkthroughs remain available in environments without LabVIEW installed.

The files are intentionally light-weight: populate them with locally generated artefacts when the
CLI is available, or copy the fixture set under `fixtures/teststand-session/` for quick validation.
