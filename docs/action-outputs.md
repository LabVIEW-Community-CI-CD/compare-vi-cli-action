# Compare VI Action: Inputs & Outputs

Generated by `npm run generate:outputs`. Do not edit manually.

**Action Name:** Compare VI (composite)
**Description:** Compare two LabVIEW (.vi) files using NI LVCompare (LabVIEW 2025 Q3). Composite action for self-hosted Windows runners with full CLI flag pass-through.

## Inputs

### base

Path to the base .vi file

- Required: true

### fail-on-diff

Fail the job if differences are found

- Required: false
- Default: `true`

### head

Path to the head .vi file

- Required: true

### histogram-bins

Number of histogram bins to compute in loop mode (0 = disabled).

- Required: false
- Default: `0`

### hybrid-exact-threshold

Hybrid strategy iterations to seed exact before switching to streaming.

- Required: false
- Default: `200`

### loop-enabled

Enable iterative compare loop mode (aggregates metrics/percentiles)

- Required: false
- Default: `false`

### loop-interval-seconds

Interval between iterations in loop mode (fractional seconds supported).

- Required: false
- Default: `0`

### loop-max-iterations

Max iterations for loop mode (0 = until diff when fail-on-diff=false, or single pass).

- Required: false
- Default: `25`

### loop-simulate

Use an internal mock executor (no real LVCompare) for loop mode (useful in CI without LabVIEW).

- Required: false
- Default: `true`

### loop-simulate-exit-code

Exit code returned by simulated executor (1 = diff; 0 = no diff).

- Required: false
- Default: `1`

### lvCompareArgs

Additional CLI flags for LVCompare.exe (space-delimited)

- Required: false

### lvComparePath

Full path to LVCompare.exe, if not on PATH

- Required: false

### quantile-strategy

Quantile strategy for loop mode: Exact | StreamingReservoir | Hybrid

- Required: false
- Default: `StreamingReservoir`

### reconcile-every

Rebuild streaming reservoir every N iterations (0 = disabled).

- Required: false
- Default: `0`

### stream-capacity

StreamingReservoir capacity (samples retained; min 10).

- Required: false
- Default: `500`

### working-directory

Directory to run LVCompare from (sets process CWD for relative paths)

- Required: false

## Outputs

### averageSeconds

Loop mode: average iteration duration (s)

### cliPath

Resolved path to LVCompare.exe

### command

Exact command line executed (for auditing)

### compareDurationNanoseconds

Execution duration in nanoseconds (high-resolution)

### compareDurationSeconds

Execution duration in seconds (floating point with millisecond precision)

### compareSummaryPath

Path to generated JSON summary (comparison metadata)

### diff

true if differences were found

### diffCount

Loop mode: number of diff iterations

### errorCount

Loop mode: number of error iterations

### exitCode

Raw exit code from LVCompare

### histogramPath

Loop mode: path to histogram JSON (if bins > 0)

### iterations

Loop mode: total iterations executed

### loopResultPath

Loop mode: path to JSON summary of loop aggregate metrics

### p50

Loop mode: latency p50 (seconds)

### p90

Loop mode: latency p90 (seconds)

### p99

Loop mode: latency p99 (seconds)

### quantileStrategy

Loop mode: effective quantile strategy used

### streamingWindowCount

Loop mode: sample count retained in streaming reservoir

### totalSeconds

Loop mode: total elapsed time (s)

### shortCircuitedIdentical

`true|false`. `true` only when (single-run mode) the action detects that `base` and `head` resolve to the **same absolute path** and it short-circuits (no LVCompare spawn) producing `exitCode=0`, `diff=false`, nearâ€‘zero duration. Prevents the LabVIEW IDE popup and unnecessary process launch.

Notes:

- Always `false` in loop mode (the iterative path never short-circuits by identical path preflight; it still validates once up front).
- Always `false` for normal (non-identical) comparisons that execute LVCompare.
- Included in the JSON summary (`compareSummaryPath`).
