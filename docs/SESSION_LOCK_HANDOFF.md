# Session Lock Guard – Work-in-Progress Handoff

## Current State
- Implemented `tools/Session-Lock.ps1` with actions: Acquire, Release, Heartbeat, Inspect.  
- Added initial unit test skeleton `tests/SessionLock.Tests.ps1` (invokes the script via helper function).  
- Wired lock acquisition/release + heartbeat into `.github/workflows/pester-reusable.yml`.  
- Created `tests/Write-SessionIndexSummary.Tests.ps1` and updated the script to handle missing properties (fixes prior failure).  
- Added placeholder Acquire/Release steps to `pester-reusable.yml`; fixture-drift and orchestrated workflows still need integration.  
- New tests currently **fail** because helper functions (`Invoke-SessionLockProcess`) defined at top of the test file are not being resolved under Pester v5 discovery (likely scoping issue). No workflow updates executed yet.

## Outstanding Work
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Fix invocation helpers so `Invoke-SessionLockProcess` and `Read-KeyValueFile` are available in test scope (options: dot-source helper module, define inside `BeforeAll`, or use `InModuleScope`).  
   - Expand tests to validate queue wait summary, status file contents, and environment variable outputs.  
   - Ensure tests clean up background jobs / temp files on failure.

2. **Workflow Integration**
   - Add session lock acquire/heartbeat/release to `.github/workflows/fixture-drift.yml` (Windows job), and to orchestrated workflows (`ci-orchestrated.yml`).  
   - Ensure queue wait instrumentation uses `Agent-Wait` (start timer when Acquire queues, stop when lock acquired).  
   - Decide on per-workflow session groups (`pester-selfhosted`, `fixture-drift-windows`, etc.) to avoid cross-job contention.

3. **Heartbeat Job**
   - Verify background heartbeat job is stopped in all exit paths (success/failure/cancel). Consider using PowerShell runspace or Start-Job alternative that does not require PSThreadJob module.  
   - Ensure heartbeat job logs warnings on failure and does not crash the step.

4. **Stale Detection**
   - Confirm Acquire handles stale locks correctly when `SESSION_FORCE_TAKEOVER` is toggled.  
   - Surface takeover info in summary and in `status.md`.  
   - Add docs describing manual unlock / takeover steps.

5. **Documentation**
   - Move this handoff into a polished doc (`docs/SESSION_LOCK.md`) once implementation stabilises.  
   - Document environment toggles (`SESSION_GROUP`, `SESSION_STALE_SECONDS`, `SESSION_FORCE_TAKEOVER`, etc.).  
   - Provide instructions for inspecting lock files (`Session-Lock.ps1 -Action Inspect`).
   - Reference the live watcher (`node tools/follow-pester-artifacts.mjs`) so hand-offs capture `[hang-suspect]` diagnostics alongside lock status when reproducing queue starvation or leaked sessions.

6. **Manual Verification**
   - After tests pass, run two workflow instances to confirm queued behaviour and gather logs for the PR.  
   - Collect evidence: step summary excerpts, dispatcher log snippet, `lock.json` content.

## Known Issues / Risks
- Unit tests currently fail because helper functions aren’t in scope.  
- Heartbeat job currently relies on `Start-ThreadJob`; confirm PSThreadJob module available in environments or replace with PowerShell runspace loop.  
- Need to guard against lock mismatch during release (if session lock id not exported for some reason).  
- Summary writes should be resilient even when `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` is unavailable (local runs).  
- Ensure `tests/results/_session_lock` is Git-ignored (currently outside repo; double-check `.gitignore`).

## Suggested Next Steps
1. Fix `SessionLock.Tests.ps1` helper scope (option: wrap helpers in `BeforeAll` and set functions via `New-Variable -Scope Script`).  
2. Re-run `./Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -TestsPath tests/SessionLock.Tests.ps1` until green.  
3. Add Acquire/Release steps to fixture drift Windows job and orchestrated Windows job.  
4. Implement queue wait instrumentation via `Agent-Wait`.  
5. Perform manual GitHub Actions validation (two simultaneous runs).  
6. Finalise documentation + add to PR.

Feel free to reach out to the previous agent’s log (job 52163034123) for reference on the Write-SessionIndexSummary failure and the current dispatcher changes. This document should give you a reliable starting point for completing the session collision guard.

## Next Agent
- Start from DEV_DASHBOARD_PLAN Phase 2 (implement Get-SessionLockStatus, Get-PesterTelemetry, etc.).
- Run dashboard unit tests once loaders are filled in.
- Continue workflow integration per plan.
