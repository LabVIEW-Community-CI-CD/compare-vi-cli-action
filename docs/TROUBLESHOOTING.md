# Troubleshooting Guide

Common issues when running the LVCompare composite action.

## Installation / path issues

### LVCompare not found

Symptoms: "LVCompare.exe not found at canonical path".

Fix:

```powershell
Test-Path 'C:\Program Files\National Instruments\Shared\LabVIEW Compare\LVCompare.exe'
```

Only the canonical path is supported; ensure LabVIEW 2025 Q3 (compare feature) is installed.

### Custom path rejected

Even when `lvComparePath`/`LVCOMPARE_PATH` is provided, it must resolve to the canonical
location. Update the runner install if the CLI lives elsewhere.

### Custom install layout

- Copy `configs/labview-paths.sample.json` to `configs/labview-paths.json` to
  list non-default `LVCompare.exe` / `LabVIEW.exe` locations. The helpers will
  read those paths before scanning the canonical Program Files directories.
- Run scripts with `-Verbose` (or `pwsh -v 5`) to see every candidate path the
  resolver evaluates when debugging missing installs.

## Exit codes & behaviour

| Exit code | Meaning | Notes |
| --------- | ------- | ----- |
| 0 | Identical | No diffs detected |
| 1 | Differences | Review outputs, HTML report |
| 2 | Invocation error | Inspect logs, rerun locally |

Set `fail-on-diff: false` to treat code 1 as notice-only.

## Performance checklist

- Use noise filters (`-noattr -nofp -nofppos -nobd -nobdcosm`).
- Shorten paths with `working-directory`.
- For UNC/long paths, map a drive or enable long-path support.

## Watcher / busy-loop signals

- `[hang-watch]` / `[hang-suspect]` → idle for extended periods.
- `[busy-watch]` / `[busy-suspect]` → log growing without progress markers.
- Use `node tools/npm/run-script.mjs dev:watcher:status` to inspect heartbeat freshness; run
  `node tools/npm/run-script.mjs dev:watcher:trim` if `needsTrim=true`.

## Loop mode hiccups

- Check `tests/results/loop/**` for JSON logs and timing stats.
- Enable leak detection (`tools/Detect-RogueLV.ps1 -FailOnRogue`).
- Close LVCompare after loop runs (`tools/Close-LVCompare.ps1`).
- Post-run cleanup retries LabVIEW shutdown automatically (up to three attempts).
  If it still fails, inspect `tests/results/_agent/post/post-run-cleanup.log`
  where the script now reports remaining PID lists before throwing and then falls
  back to `tools/Force-CloseLabVIEW.ps1` to terminate LabVIEW/LVCompare forcibly.

## Test environment tips

- Run `./Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -IntegrationMode include` to repro CI suites.
- Use `tools/Dev-Dashboard.ps1` for a quick telemetry snapshot (locks, queue waits).
- Hand-offs: `tools/Print-AgentHandoff.ps1 -AutoTrim` surfaces watcher state and trims logs.
- Spot-check LVCompare/LabVIEWCLI behaviour locally with
  `tools/Verify-LocalDiffSession.ps1`; VS Code tasks **Local: Verify diff session (stub)**
  and **Local: Verify diff session (real)** wire in the common parameters.

## Git difftool overlap (duplicate CLI invocations)

Symptoms: LabVIEWCLI.exe appears to launch twice during a manual diff, or CLI capture runs unexpectedly when using a Git difftool/IDE diff.

Why it happens:
- Git difftool/mergetool may be configured to invoke LabVIEWCLI, while the compare helper also uses the CLI (CreateComparisonReport) to generate HTML artifacts. Both can fire for the same intent.

Mitigations:
- Suppress CLI capture during Git difftool sessions:

```powershell
$env:COMPAREVI_SUPPRESS_CLI_IN_GIT = '1'   # skip CLI when a Git context is detected
$env:COMPAREVI_WARN_CLI_IN_GIT     = '1'   # optional: emit a warning when in Git context
```

- Short‑TTL duplicate suppression for repeated compare of the same pair:

```powershell
$env:COMPAREVI_CLI_SENTINEL_TTL = '60'     # seconds; suppress duplicate CLI for (vi1,vi2[,reportPath]) within TTL
```

- Hard opt‑out (no CLI capture at all in the current process):

```powershell
$env:COMPAREVI_NO_CLI_CAPTURE = '1'
```

Notes:
- These toggles are process‑scoped. Set them in the same shell/terminal that runs the compare.
- When suppression is active, the capture JSON records `environment.cli.skipped=true` with a `skipReason` (e.g., `git-context`).
