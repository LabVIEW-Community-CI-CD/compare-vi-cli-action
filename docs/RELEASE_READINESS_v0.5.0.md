# Release Readiness Investigation (v0.5.0)

## Checklist status

| Checklist item | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pester (windows-latest) | ⚠️ At risk | Latest Windows XML shows the targeted Run-AutonomousIntegrationLoop tests passing, but the full dispatcher log from a broader run reports two failures in the same suite, so the unit surface still needs attention before release. |
| Pester self-hosted (IntegrationMode include) | ❌ Blocked | Dispatcher attempt recurses endlessly through the IncludePatterns tests, preventing completion and leaving no artifacts to verify. |
| Fixture Drift (Windows/Ubuntu) | ✅ Passing | Current and baseline fixture validation JSON reports show no missing/untracked fixtures or size mismatches. |
| Validate workflow (actionlint, docs links) | ⚠️ Not verified | Release checklist items for Validate remain unchecked, so the status is still unconfirmed. |
| LabVIEW/LVCompare guard | ❌ Blocked | Latest TestStand session index records a CLI compare failure because no provider can service `CreateComparisonReport`, so no clean guard confirmation exists. |

## Key findings

- The hosted Windows NUnit export indicates the Run-AutonomousIntegrationLoop tests pass in isolation, but the more comprehensive dispatcher run still fails two guard scenarios (`retains shadow effectiveness...`, `flags discovery failure...`), keeping the suite red overall. 
- Self-hosted dispatcher runs with `-IntegrationMode exclude` remain unstable; IncludePatterns recursion spins up child dispatchers indefinitely, so the release gate cannot be exercised. 
- Fixture validation remains green with identical `summaryCounts`, suggesting fixture drift is not blocking the release. 
- The TestStand CLI sample session logs stop with a `CreateComparisonReport` provider error, meaning LVCompare automation is not verified for this build. 
- Quantile polling loop telemetry stays healthy (no diffs or errors), indicating the instrumentation path is stable even while other gates fail. 
- The standing-priority sync still operates on cached metadata because the GitHub CLI is unauthenticated, so automated release status dashboards are stale.

## Recommended next steps

1. Stabilize the dispatcher failures reported in `full-run.log`, then rerun the full suite to capture clean NUnit and summary artifacts.
2. Address the IncludePatterns recursion in the self-hosted dispatcher so integration mode exits normally; once fixed, rerun with `-IntegrationMode include` to populate the release checklist evidence.
3. Reconfigure LVCompare/TestStand automation so the CLI provider can satisfy `CreateComparisonReport`, then regenerate the session index.
4. Authenticate `gh` (or provide `GH_TOKEN`) so `priority:sync` refreshes the standing issue data before the next release audit.
5. Once the gates above are green, execute the Validate workflow (actionlint + docs links) and record its results alongside this readiness report.
