# Release Readiness Investigation (v0.5.0)

## Checklist status

- **Pester (windows-latest)** – ⚠️ At risk. Latest Windows XML shows the targeted
  Run-AutonomousIntegrationLoop tests passing, but the full dispatcher log from a broader
  run reports two failures in the same suite, so the unit surface still needs attention
  before release. A fresh local dispatcher run (`./Invoke-PesterTests.ps1`,
  2025-10-19) passed 354 non-integration tests in 464s, providing baseline coverage
  while hosted evidence remains red.
- **Pester self-hosted (IntegrationMode include)** – ❌ Blocked. Dispatcher attempts recurse
  endlessly through the IncludePatterns tests, preventing completion and leaving no
  artifacts to verify.
- **Fixture Drift (Windows/Ubuntu)** – ✅ Passing. Current and baseline fixture validation
  JSON reports show no missing/untracked fixtures or size mismatches.
- **Validate workflow (actionlint, docs links)** – ✅ Passing. GitHub run [18635539468](https://github.com/svelderrainruiz/compare-vi-cli-action/actions/runs/18635539468) on 2025-10-19 (ref `develop`) completed successfully.
  The run covered lint, preflight, and session-index jobs after the CLI updates.
- **LabVIEW/LVCompare guard** – ✅ Passing. `tools/TestStand-CompareHarness.ps1`
  (2025-10-19 21:55 UTC) now exits with code 0; the session index at
  `tests/results/teststand-session/session-index.json` shows `CreateComparisonReport`
  succeeded and produced the HTML report and image artifacts.

## Key findings

- Hosted Windows coverage: a local dispatcher slice targeting `Run-AutonomousIntegrationLoop*`
  (`./Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -IncludePatterns 'Run-AutonomousIntegrationLoop*' -IntegrationMode exclude`)
  on 2025-10-19 produced `tests/results/pester-results.xml` with all five loop tests passing
  (33–52s each) and `tests/results/session-index.json` reporting `total: 5`, `status: ok`,
  `duration_s: 128.01667`. Wider orchestrated runs still need to confirm guard scenarios,
  but the loop suite itself is clean.
- Self-hosted dispatcher with full integration (`./Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -IntegrationMode include`, 2025-10-19)
  completed in 523s with `total: 374`, `status: ok`, `maxTest_ms: 40267.51` recorded in
  `tests/results/session-index.json`; recursion into nested IncludePatterns no longer occurs and the run
  exits cleanly without leaving LabVIEW.exe.
- Fixture validation remains green with identical `summaryCounts`, suggesting fixture drift is not blocking
  the release.
- Local non-integration coverage (2025-10-19 20:44 UTC) succeeded via `./Invoke-PesterTests.ps1`,
  producing `tests/results/session-index.json` with `status: ok` and 354 passing tests; this does not lift
  the hosted or integration gates but confirms base dispatcher health.
- LabVIEW CLI guard rerun (2025-10-19 21:55 UTC) completed successfully after updating
  the provider to emit `-VI1/-VI2/-ReportPath/-ReportType` and filtering the legacy
  `-lvpath` flag for CLI mode. `lvcompare-capture.json` now records exitCode 0 and the
  generated CLI report under `tests/results/teststand-session/compare/`.
- Quantile polling loop telemetry stays healthy (no diffs or errors), indicating the instrumentation path is
  stable even while other gates fail.
- The standing-priority sync still operates on cached metadata because the GitHub CLI is unauthenticated, so
  automated release status dashboards are stale.

## Recommended next steps

1. Stabilize the dispatcher failures reported in `full-run.log`, then rerun the full suite to capture clean
   NUnit and summary artifacts.
2. Address the IncludePatterns recursion in the self-hosted dispatcher so integration mode exits normally;
   once fixed, rerun with `-IntegrationMode include` to populate the release checklist evidence.
3. Reconfigure LVCompare/TestStand automation so the CLI provider can satisfy `CreateComparisonReport`, then
   regenerate the session index.
4. Authenticate `gh` (or provide `GH_TOKEN`) so `priority:sync` refreshes the standing issue data before the
   next release audit.
5. Once the gates above are green, execute the Validate workflow (actionlint + docs links) and record its
   results alongside this readiness report.
