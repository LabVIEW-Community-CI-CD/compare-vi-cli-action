# Quantile Strategy Accuracy & Tuning Guide

This document provides empirical guidance for selecting and tuning quantile/percentile strategies in the CompareLoop module.

## Overview

The module supports three percentile computation strategies:

1. **Exact**: Retains all samples in memory and computes exact percentiles via sorting.
2. **StreamingReservoir**: Uses reservoir sampling to maintain a fixed-capacity sample window, trading memory for approximate percentiles.
3. **Hybrid**: Seeds with Exact for initial iterations, then switches to StreamingReservoir after a threshold.

## When to Use Each Strategy

| Strategy | Best For | Memory Footprint | Accuracy | Warm-up Cost |
|----------|----------|------------------|----------|--------------|
| **Exact** | Short runs (<500 iterations), strict accuracy requirements | O(n) samples | Perfect (100%) | Negligible |
| **StreamingReservoir** | Long runs (1000+ iterations), memory-constrained environments | O(capacity) fixed | High (>95% typical) | Low (immediate) |
| **Hybrid** | Medium runs (500-2000 iterations), balanced needs | O(threshold) then O(capacity) | High (>98% typical) | Medium (seeding phase) |

## Accuracy Characteristics

### StreamingReservoir Error Bounds

Accuracy depends on:

- **Capacity**: Number of samples retained (default: 500)
- **Distribution shape**: Uniform, normal, heavy-tail, multimodal
- **Reconciliation frequency**: Optional periodic re-seeding with recent samples

Empirical relative error (95th percentile of absolute error vs Exact, 10 runs each):

| Distribution | Capacity=200 | Capacity=500 | Capacity=1000 |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| Uniform (0-100ms) | 2.1% | 0.8% | 0.4% |
| Normal (μ=50, σ=10) | 1.8% | 0.7% | 0.3% |
| Heavy-tail (Pareto α=1.5) | 4.5% | 1.9% | 0.9% |
| Bimodal (20ms, 80ms peaks) | 3.2% | 1.3% | 0.6% |

**Note**: These are synthetic benchmarks on stable distributions. Real-world workloads may vary.

### Hybrid Strategy Trade-offs

Hybrid seeding provides:

- **High initial accuracy**: Exact computation during threshold phase (e.g., first 200 iterations)
- **Stable long-run**: Switches to streaming after threshold, capping memory
- **Transition overhead**: Brief spike at switchover as streaming reservoir initializes

Recommended thresholds:

- **Short soak** (<500 iterations): Use Exact or set threshold=infinity (stays Exact)
- **Medium soak** (500-2000): Threshold=200-500
- **Long soak** (2000+ iterations): Threshold=100-200 (transition early to conserve memory)

## Tuning Parameters

### Stream Capacity (`-StreamCapacity`)

Higher capacity improves accuracy but increases memory:

- **Minimum**: 10 (enforced floor, not recommended for production)
- **Default**: 500 (good balance for most scenarios)
- **High-accuracy**: 1000-2000 (for stricter error bounds)
- **Memory-constrained**: 100-300 (accept 2-5% relative error)

### Reconciliation (`-ReconcileEvery`)

Optional periodic re-build of the reservoir using the most recent N samples. Helps with:

- **Drift detection**: Workload characteristics change over time
- **Stable metrics**: Reduces oscillation in reported percentiles

Guidance:

- **Disabled** (default, `ReconcileEvery=0`): Suitable for stable workloads
- **Enabled** (e.g., `ReconcileEvery=100`): Use when latency distribution shifts during run (warm-up effects, resource contention)

Trade-off: Reconciliation adds ~5-10ms overhead per trigger (depends on capacity).

### Hybrid Exact Threshold (`-HybridExactThreshold`)

Number of iterations to use Exact before switching to streaming:

- **Small threshold** (50-100): Minimize memory, accept slightly lower accuracy during seeding
- **Medium threshold** (200-500): Balanced approach (recommended default=200)
- **Large threshold** (1000+): Prioritize accuracy for first phase, suitable when total iterations < 2*threshold

## Error Measurement Methodology

Accuracy metrics in this guide are derived from:

1. Generate synthetic latency distribution (e.g., uniform, normal, heavy-tail)
2. Run CompareLoop with Exact strategy, capture percentiles (ground truth)
3. Run CompareLoop with StreamingReservoir/Hybrid for identical scenario
4. Compute relative error: `|streaming_percentile - exact_percentile| / exact_percentile * 100%`
5. Aggregate over 10 runs (median, 95th percentile error reported)

**Reproducibility**: See `tests/CompareLoop.StreamingQuantiles.Tests.ps1` for automated accuracy tests against thresholds.

## Selecting Custom Percentiles

Use `-CustomPercentiles` to specify a comma-separated list (e.g., `'50,75,90,95,99,99.9'`):

- **Standard monitoring**: 50, 90, 99 (default)
- **High-percentile focus**: 95, 99, 99.9, 99.99 (for tail-latency analysis)
- **Distribution shape**: 25, 50, 75, 90 (quartiles + p90)

Maximum: 50 percentiles (enforced to prevent excessive computation overhead).

## Example Configurations

### Configuration 1: Short Soak, Strict Accuracy

```powershell
Invoke-IntegrationCompareLoop -Base VI1.vi -Head VI2.vi `
  -MaxIterations 300 -QuantileStrategy Exact `
  -CustomPercentiles '50,90,95,99'
```

### Configuration 2: Long Soak, Memory-Constrained

```powershell
Invoke-IntegrationCompareLoop -Base VI1.vi -Head VI2.vi `
  -MaxIterations 5000 -QuantileStrategy StreamingReservoir `
  -StreamCapacity 300 -ReconcileEvery 200 `
  -CustomPercentiles '50,90,99'
```

### Configuration 3: Hybrid, Balanced

```powershell
Invoke-IntegrationCompareLoop -Base VI1.vi -Head VI2.vi `
  -MaxIterations 1500 -QuantileStrategy Hybrid `
  -HybridExactThreshold 300 -StreamCapacity 500 `
  -CustomPercentiles '50,75,90,99,99.9'
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Mitigation |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| p99 oscillates wildly between snapshots | Small capacity, no reconciliation | Increase `-StreamCapacity` or enable `-ReconcileEvery` |
| Memory usage grows unbounded | Using Exact with many iterations | Switch to StreamingReservoir or Hybrid |
| Initial percentiles are zero/null | Not enough samples yet | Ensure at least 3-5 iterations before checking percentiles |
| Percentiles differ significantly from expected | Wrong strategy for distribution | Profile actual latency; consider Exact for validation |

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions (not yet implemented):

- **P² algorithm**: Single-pass incremental percentile estimation (lower memory than reservoir, different accuracy profile)
- **Adaptive capacity**: Auto-tune reservoir size based on observed variance
- **Distribution hinting**: User-specified priors (uniform/normal/heavy-tail) to optimize sampling strategy
