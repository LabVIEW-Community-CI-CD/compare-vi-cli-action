# CI Orchestration Redesign Plan

> Objective: restore deterministic workflows while paving the way toward the
> cross-platform .NET CLI runner that unifies LVCompare / telemetry logic.

## Current Pain Points

- **Duplicate Windows footprints** – `ci-orchestrated.yml` runs a hosted
  `windows-latest` preflight and the full self-hosted Pester suite. Shared
  composite actions (e.g., `ensure-invoker`) create scripts in `tests/results`,
  so hosted steps race with self-hosted runs and surface parser errors.
- **Shared results directory** – every Windows job writes to `tests/results`,
  mixing artifacts from dispatcher/schema/comparevi/loop categories. When
  retries are queued, late arrivals see inconsistent state.
- **Mixed platform assumptions** – Pester is cross-platform, but many categories
  still assume LVCompare lives on Windows. That blocks us from running the same
  logic on Linux/macOS ahead of the .NET CLI rollout.

## Design Principles

1. **Pester-first, platform-neutral** – tests must run anywhere PowerShell 7 +
   .NET CLI are available; LabVIEW-specific shims become optional layers.
2. **Deterministic outputs** – each job owns a unique results directory and
   writes provenance + session-index without stepping on other jobs.
3. **Explicit orchestration** – hosted/Windows responsibilities are modelled as
   separate jobs with zero shared state. Hosted jobs never try to launch the
   invoker or write invoker artifacts.
4. **Incremental CLI adoption** – migrate to the planned .NET compare runner in
   stages so we keep coverage while removing Windows-only assumptions.

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1 – Stabilise the existing workflow (in progress)

- Update `.github/actions/ensure-invoker` with an opt-in `requireInvoker`
  switch. Hosted gate jobs call it with `requireInvoker:false` (no wrapper
  emission; pure health check).
- Scope every Windows job to a unique results root. Example:
  `tests/results/dispatcher`, `tests/results/schema`, … This removes cross-job
  contamination.
- Introduce a hosted Windows gate job (`hosted-gate`) that runs ahead of the
  self-hosted matrix and prevents the invoker from launching when the hosted
  environment fails basic health checks.
- Gate all composite steps with platform checks (`if: runner.os == 'Windows'`)
  so Linux/macOS jobs never call LVCompare or invoker helpers.
- Verify deterministic artifacts by re-running orchestrated single strategy
  with identical inputs (`ts-<timestamp>-*`) and comparing provenance hashes.

### Phase 2 – Introduce the .NET CLI shim

- Land the shared CLI (`CompareVI.Cli.dll`) that wraps LVCompare and telemetry
  emission. Expose a single entry point we can call from PowerShell.
- Refactor Pester helper scripts to invoke the CLI instead of spawning
  LabVIEW/LVCompare directly. Retain Windows-specific fallbacks while the CLI
  develops parity.
- Add Linux/macOS jobs that run the CLI-only Pester categories. These jobs skip
  LVCompare-dependent tests until fixtures are ported.

### Phase 3 – Consolidate orchestrated paths

- Replace the hosted Windows preflight with a pure CLI smoke job (Linux +
  macOS). Enforce LVCompare presence only on the self-hosted runner.
- Collapse the `pester-category` fan-out into a single matrix driven by
  category name & OS, routed through the CLI.
- Simplify `windows-single` to a thin wrapper that downloads artifacts and
  publishes Dev Dashboard state; the CLI handles diffing/telemetry.

## Audit Checklist (in-flight)

- [ ] `ensure-invoker` updated with hosted opt-out
- [ ] Unique results directory per Windows job
- [ ] Hosted Windows jobs no longer spawn invoker scripts
- [ ] Deterministic orchestrated run verified (`gh run view …`)
- [ ] CLI prototype added (optional toggle via workflow variable)
- [ ] Linux/macOS Pester suites executing CLI tests
- [ ] Documentation updated (`docs/DEV_DASHBOARD_PLAN.md`, README)

## Risk & Mitigation

- **CLI parity gap** – Maintain Windows-only categories for LVCompare fixtures
  until the CLI exposes equivalent features. Mark remaining gaps in a separate
  tracker.
- **Self-hosted capacity** – Consolidating categories may stress the single
  runner. Add an optional matrix throttle (`max-parallel: 1`) to preserve
  determinism.
- **Artifact schema drift** – Ensure provenance/session-index schema updates are
  reviewed as part of the CLI migration to prevent consumer regressions.

---

This plan keeps Pester as the core test runner, removes the duplicated Windows
surface, and gives us a clear path to the cross-platform CLI without sacrificing
the existing LVCompare integrations.
