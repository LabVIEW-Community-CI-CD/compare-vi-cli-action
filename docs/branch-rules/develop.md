# Develop Branch Rules (additions)

Develop generally mirrors `docs/BRANCH_RULES.md`. If needed, document any temporary deviations here. Examples:

- Additional or experimental checks required only on `develop`
- Temporary waiver and the issue tracking its removal
- Links to relevant CI runs

To enforce the Branch Protection Gate on `develop`, set repo variable `ENFORCE_PROTECTION_ON_DEVELOP=1`.
