This backmerge PR brings all fixture drift orchestration improvements from the release branch into develop.

Highlights
- Composite action: .github/actions/fixture-drift/action.yml orchestrates drift validation, artifact upload, PR comment, step summary, and schema-lite validation.
- Blocking workflow: .github/workflows/fixture-drift.yml with minimal permissions; designed to be set as Required.
- Sticky PR comment with direct artifact links, fork-safe and idempotent; updates existing bot comment instead of duplicating.
- Enriched drift-summary.json with schema (fixture-drift-summary-v1), generatedAtUtc, and per-file timestamps/lengths; deterministic ordering.
- JSON schema (Draft-07) at docs/schemas/fixture-drift-summary-v1.schema.json; validated in CI via tools/Invoke-JsonSchemaLite.ps1.
- Manual helper: scripts/Debug-FixtureDrift.ps1 for local end-to-end drift runs, avoiding quoting pitfalls.
- Docs: README + docs/SCHEMA_HELPER.md updated; usage, outputs, and troubleshooting guidance.
- Tests: New/extended Pester tests to assert schema fields, HTML diff determinism, and workflow guards.

Additional changes pulled forward
- Hardened CompareVI and dispatcher logic; new aggregation helpers and schema coverage; expanded troubleshooting docs.
- New tools: Validate-Fixtures, Update-FixtureManifest, Diff-FixtureValidationJson, Write-FixtureValidationSummary, etc.

Acceptance
- Unit tests pass locally. Integration tests require LVCompare at canonical path.
- Non-deterministic ordering avoided; exit code mapping unchanged.

Follow-ups
- Consider adding composite behavior tests and making the drift job Required in repository settings.

Notes
- This merges release/v0.4.0-rc.1 â†’ develop to keep branches in sync before finalizing v0.4.1.
