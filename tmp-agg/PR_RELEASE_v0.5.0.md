# Release v0.5.0 (RC merge)

## Summary

- Session index (`session-index.json`) added with status, summary counts, artifact pointers, run context URLs, and a pre-rendered `stepSummary`.
- New schema: `docs/schemas/session-index-v1.schema.json` and schema-lite validation wired in CI (validate, self-hosted, hosted, smoke, integration-on-label).
- Drift action hardened: reliable `drift-summary.json` discovery (timestamped and direct paths) + debug breadcrumbs; "unknown" status resolved.
- Dispatcher: hard gate on running `LabVIEW.exe`; LVCompare post-run cleanup is opt-in via `CLEAN_LVCOMPARE=1`.
- Artifact manifest includes `session-index.json`; workflows append session index summaries and upload as artifact.
- Manifest size policy migrated `minBytes` to `bytes` (exact).

## Breaking

- `fixtures.manifest.json` now requires `bytes` instead of `minBytes`. Repo tooling and validators updated.
