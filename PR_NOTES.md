# Release v0.5.1 – PR Notes Helper (Do Not Ship With Final Tag)

Reference sheet for refining the v0.5.1 release PR/description. Summarizes the major themes, validation
expectations, and follow-ups captured in #134.

## 1. Summary

Release v0.5.1 focuses on four pillars:

- Deterministic self-hosted Windows CI: per-ref concurrency + cancel-in-progress, guard preflight, and post-run
  cleanup enforcement so orchestrated runs finish without manual intervention.
- Session index everywhere: every dispatcher run writes `tests/results/session-index.json`, uploads it, and appends the
  `stepSummary` snippet for easy triage.
- Fixture policy modernization: `fixtures.manifest.json` now records exact `bytes`, drift workflows consume the new
  shape, and the validator produces actionable size mismatch diagnostics.
- Drift/report hardening & tooling hygiene: LVCompare exec JSON becomes the primary drift report source, docs linting
  runs in Validate, and the repository ships a vendor tool resolver plus Docker helper to keep non-LV checks consistent.

## 2. Deterministic CI & Guard Highlights

- Orchestrated workflows use concurrency groups with cancel-on-new-ref to prevent queue buildup.
- Guard preflight blocks dispatcher launches when `LabVIEW.exe` is already running; post-run guard summarizes cleanup.
- Validate now runs actionlint *before* markdownlint so YAML issues fail fast.
- Published tools image (`ghcr.io/labview-community-ci-cd/comparevi-tools`) powers priority sync and non-LV checks.

## 3. Session Index & Telemetry

- Dispatcher emits `session-index.json` containing run status, artifact paths, timing metrics, and a ready-to-append
  summary block.
- `tools/Update-SessionIndexBranchProtection.ps1` maintains the contract between `session-index.json` and required
  checks (`tools/policy/branch-required-checks.json`).
- Watchers ingest the session index (REST watcher writes `watcher-rest.json`; helper merges into the session index).
- New docs (`docs/CI_ORCHESTRATION_REDESIGN.md`, `docs/WATCHER_TELEMETRY_DX.md`) explain how the telemetry pieces fit.

## 4. Fixture & Drift Updates

- `fixtures.manifest.json` adopts `bytes` (exact size) and supports the additive `pair` block (`fixture-pair/v1`).
- Drift jobs trust the LVCompare exec JSON (`compare-exec.json`) for summaries and publish deterministic artifacts.
- Validator CLI (`tools/Validate-Fixtures.ps1`) learned `-RequirePair` / `-FailOnExpectedMismatch` to enforce policy.
- README + integration docs call out the new fixture expectations and still reference the canonical `VI1.vi` / `VI2.vi`.

## 5. Tooling & Developer Experience

- `tools/VendorTools.psm1` resolves actionlint, markdownlint, and LVCompare paths consistently.
- `tools/Run-NonLVChecksInDocker.ps1` provides a containerized fallback for Validate linting.
- Priority router + handoff helpers (`tools/priority/*`) power the new standing-priority automation (cache, schema,
  semver check, release simulation).
- VS Code extension scaffolding (comparevi) ships as an experimental companion.

## 6. Upgrade Notes & Compatibility

- Consumers must update any manifest tooling to read `bytes` instead of `minBytes`.
- Session index is additive; action inputs/outputs remain unchanged.
- No breaking changes to CompareVI CLI invocation—LVCompare/LabVIEW guard is stricter but bypassable via env toggles
  documented in `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md`.

## 7. Validation Snapshot (goal = all checked before merge/tag)

- [ ] Validate workflow (actionlint, markdownlint, docs links) - rerun until clean.
- [ ] `./Invoke-PesterTests.ps1` (non-integration) - expect PASS, session index uploaded.
- [ ] Self-hosted integration run (`./Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -IntegrationMode include`) - ensure guard/integration path
      exits cleanly.
- [ ] Fixture drift jobs (Windows + Ubuntu) - confirm size/bytes alignment.
- [ ] LabVIEW CLI provider smoke: `tools/TestStand-CompareHarness.ps1` should complete without `CreateComparisonReport`
      errors.
- [ ] `node tools/npm/run-script.mjs priority:release` succeeds, writing `tests/results/_agent/handoff/release-summary.json`.

## 7a. Compare History Artifact Sanity

- Confirm `tests/results/ref-compare-history/history-summary.json` exists, schema=`vi-history-compare/v1`, and `pairs` matches the commit window inspected.
- For each pair, open the matching `*-summary.json`; ensure `cli.diff`, `exitCode`, and `reportHtml` align with expectations (diffs have `exitCode = 1`, identical runs stay at `0`).
- Spot-check the rendered report (`cli-report.html`) for at least the first diff, verifying highlighted sections reflect the regression under review.
- Ensure highlights captured in the summary (`cli.highlights`) mirror the report and that the artifact directory holds stdout/stderr captures for triage.
- If `IncludeIdenticalPairs` was enabled, verify identical entries are flagged (`skippedIdentical=true`) and excluded from markdown rows when not requested.

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Guard still reports rogue LabVIEW.exe | Dispatcher blocks post-merge | Keep `tools/Detect-RogueLV.ps1` in the release branch CI; ensure guard summaries stay green |
| Fixture manifest consumers ignore `bytes` | Downstream size checks fail | Highlight in CHANGELOG/README; keep `minBytes` compatibility shim only where necessary |
| Session index not appended in forks | Reduced telemetry | Document fallback in README + watcher docs; keep branch protection script aligned |
| Dockerized non-LV checks lack GH token | priority:sync/drift fails | Ship guidance to set `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` (added to docs/ENVIRONMENT.md) |

## 9. Follow-Up Work After v0.5.1

1. Composite action consolidation and managed tokenizer adoption (tracked in standing issue #134).
2. Extend session index watcher integration to additional workflows (rest + artifact merger).
3. Evaluate defaulting discovery strictness once telemetry shows stability.
4. Continue VS Code extension hardening (command palette + compare orchestration).

## 10. Reviewer Notes

- Focus reviews on CI determinism (concurrency wiring, guard steps), session index payload shape, fixture validator
  behaviour, and docs/tooling alignment.
- Double-check that `docs/action-outputs.md`, `action.yml`, and README tables match.
- Ensure release artifacts (`RELEASE_NOTES_v0.5.0.md`, changelog section) remain consistent with changes landed after
  the standing-priority sync.
