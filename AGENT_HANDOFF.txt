# Agent Handoff – Compare VI CLI Action

## Context Snapshot
- Branch: `issue/127-remove-develop-two-green` (tied to #127, PR #132)
- Primary focus: REST watcher telemetry + CLI validation (already merged as PR #131) and removal of the obsolete `develop-two-green` workflow.
- Latest change staged: deleted `.github/workflows/develop-two-green.yml`.

## Status & Known Gaps
1. **Branch protection**
   - `develop` still lists `Workflows Lint` as a required status even though the workflow was retired. Update branch protection so only `Validate` is required:
     ```bash
     gh api repos/LabVIEW-Community-CI-CD/compare-vi-cli-action/branches/develop/protection \
       -X PUT \
       -F required_status_checks.strict=true \
       -F required_status_checks.checks[][context]=Validate
     ```

2. **CLI & watcher telemetry (from PR #131)**
   - `npm run cli:validate` builds/validates `comparevi-cli`; lint job now publishes `watcher-rest.json`.
   - `tools/Update-SessionIndexWatcher.ps1` merges watcher output into `session-index.json` (`watchers.rest` node). Ensure any downstream tools expecting `session-index` ingest the new field.

3. **Open PRs**
   - #131: feat: add REST watcher telemetry ⇒ waiting on Validate; branch protection update above removes redundant `Workflows Lint`.
   - #132: chore: remove develop-two-green workflow ⇒ this branch; lint/validate pending after branch protection fix.

## Suggested Next Actions
1. Run the branch protection update command to drop `Workflows Lint`.
2. Re-run CI on PRs #131 and #132 once protection updates propagate; merge when Validate passes.
3. Confirm session index uploads include `watchers.rest` and document schema changes in release notes.
4. After merging, update any SLO/automation docs referencing `develop-two-green`.

## Useful Commands
- Update protection: see command above.
- Validate CLI locally: `npm run cli:validate` (requires `dotnet publish` output).
- Watch REST output: `npm run ci:watch:rest -- --run-id <id> --out tests/results/<job>/watcher-rest.json`.
- Merge watcher data manually (if needed): `pwsh -File tools/Update-SessionIndexWatcher.ps1 -ResultsDir <dir> -WatcherJson <dir>/watcher-rest.json`.

## Notes for Next Agent
- Expect PR #131 to satisfy the only required check (`Validate`) once protection is updated; `Workflows Lint` should disappear from required contexts.
- After deleting `develop-two-green`, ensure no other workflow or doc references it (quick check already done via `git grep`).
