Progress: history suite now writes one aggregate manifest (`vi-compare/history-suite@v1`) plus per-mode manifests. `tools/Compare-VIHistory.ps1` no longer runs per-mode loops separately, and the manual workflow consumes the suite output instead of stitching manifests on its own.
Progress: Added GitHub-output coverage + docs so dashboards/metrics can deserialize `mode-manifests-json` for per-mode artifact routing.

Tests: 12/12 passing via `./Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -TestsPath tests/CompareVI.History.Tests.ps1 -IntegrationMode include`.

Next session:
  1) Spot-check downstream dashboards/metrics after the next workflow run to confirm the refreshed `mode-manifests-json` payload looks healthy.
  2) Once the branch lands on `develop`, rerun `vi-compare-refs.yml` to ensure artifact uploads and diff scanning behave with the new suite manifests.
