Progress: history suite now writes one aggregate manifest (`vi-compare/history-suite@v1`) plus per-mode manifests, and the manual workflow consumes the suite output instead of stitching manifests on its own.
Progress: Added GitHub-output coverage + docs so dashboards/metrics can deserialize `mode-manifests-json` for per-mode artifact routing.
Progress: Dev Dashboard loaders + CLI render the history suite using the new mode manifest JSON; sample fixtures live under `tools/dashboard/samples/ref-compare/history/`.
Progress: Prepped v0.5.2 release collateral (CHANGELOG, release notes, PR checklist/description, tag prep) and bumped `package.json` to `0.5.2`.
Progress: Scoped and began implementing branch protection guard plan (#302): added `policy-guard-upstream.yml` so upstream PRs run `check-policy.mjs`; policy manifest/tests now require the new status.

Tests: `./Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -TestsPath tests/CompareVI.History.Tests.ps1 -IntegrationMode include` (12/12) and `./Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -TestsPath tests -IncludePatterns 'DevDashboard.*'` (10/10). `node tools/npm/run-script.mjs priority:handoff-tests` (4/4) and `node tools/priority/validate-semver.mjs` (0.5.2 valid).

Next session:
  1) Finish upstream merge for release/v0.5.2 (PR #301) and rerun `node tools/priority/finalize-release.mjs v0.5.2` once checks are green.
  2) Update branch protection to require `Policy Guard (Upstream) / policy-guard` on develop/main/release and remove the fork lint job from the required list; rerun the guard with an admin token to confirm.
  3) After release merge, rerun `vi-compare-refs.yml` and spot-check dashboards ingesting refreshed history manifests.
