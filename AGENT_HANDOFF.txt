# Agent Handoff - Compare VI CLI Action

## Context Snapshot
- Installed GitHub CLI via apt (`gh --version` → 2.45.0) but left it unauthenticated; `gh auth status` still reports "not logged in".
- Added Microsoft's apt repository, installed PowerShell 7 (`pwsh --version` → 7.5.3), and expanded the Pester 5.5.0 `.nupkg` into `~/.local/share/powershell/Modules/Pester/5.5.0` so `Import-Module Pester -MinimumVersion 5` succeeds.
- Applied the handoff toggles (`pwsh -NoLogo -File tools/Print-AgentHandoff.ps1 -ApplyToggles`).
- Ran `node tools/npm/run-script.mjs priority:sync`; without auth it fell back to the cached standing issue and refreshed `.agent_priority_cache.json` at 2025-10-16T19:19:36Z with the same login error.
- Attempted `pwsh -NoLogo -File Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -IntegrationMode exclude`. The dispatcher enumerated 145 files and began spawning worker `pwsh` instances, but after ~20 minutes it was still chewing through new child processes without emitting `pester-summary.json` or XML results. I terminated the run (`pkill`/`kill`) to unblock the session; only guard output (`tests/results/_diagnostics/guard.json`) and the selected-file list were written.
- Captured a fresh rogue sweep (`tools/Detect-RogueLV.ps1 ... -LookBackSeconds 900 -AppendToStepSummary`) — no live or rogue LV/LVCompare processes were detected and new notices landed under `tests/results/_lvcompare_notice/`.
- Working tree remains on branch `work`; no commits existed prior to this session.

## Status & Known Gaps
1. GitHub CLI remains unauthenticated, so standing-priority syncs rely on cached metadata (`lastFetchError` still instructs to run `gh auth login`).
2. Dispatcher coverage is still missing: the latest run was aborted after sustained worker churn and left no `pester-summary.json`, NUnit XML, or session summaries in `tests/results/`.
3. `tests/results/_diagnostics/guard.json` shows repeated "Results path points to a file" notices from the guard test; a successful end-to-end dispatcher pass is still outstanding.
4. TestStand/CLI artifacts and watcher telemetry remain untouched; issue/PR #134 has not been updated with the current toolchain rebuild or the incomplete dispatcher attempt.

## Suggested Next Actions
1. Authenticate `gh` (or export `GH_TOKEN`) and rerun `node tools/npm/run-script.mjs priority:sync` so `.agent_priority_cache.json` and the router artifacts reflect live data.
2. Re-run `Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -IntegrationMode exclude`, investigate why the worker processes never converge, and capture the expected `tests/results` outputs (summary JSON, XML, guard telemetry, watcher capsules).
3. Once the dispatcher run succeeds, sync its findings — along with the restored PowerShell/Pester toolchain details and rogue sweep — back to issue/PR #134.
4. Continue the rogue LV sweep cadence via `tools/Detect-RogueLV.ps1` after major PowerShell runs.

## First Actions for the Next Agent
1. Log into GitHub CLI (or set `GH_TOKEN`) and confirm `priority:sync` succeeds without the cached-only fallback.
2. Drive a full dispatcher pass (`Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -IntegrationMode exclude`), ensuring the worker churn is understood/resolved and the standard `tests/results` artifacts are produced.
3. Update issue/PR #134 with the environment restoration status and dispatcher outcomes.
4. Run the rogue LV detection helper to keep `_lvcompare_notice` fresh.

## Notes for Next Agent
- Pester 5.5.0 lives at `~/.local/share/powershell/Modules/Pester/5.5.0`; PowerShell 7.5.3 is under `/opt/microsoft/powershell/7/pwsh`.
- `.agent_priority_cache.json` now records the 2025-10-16T19:19:36Z cached sync attempt (error still points to `gh auth login`).
- `tests/results/_diagnostics/guard.json` documents the guard failures from the aborted dispatcher run; `tests/results/pester-selected-files.txt` lists the 145 test files that were queued.
- No watcher artifacts or `pester-summary.json` exist yet; the dispatcher termination left several defunct worker `pwsh` processes that `init` will reap (use `pkill -f pwsh` if any linger before the next run).
- Latest rogue sweep (`tests/results/_lvcompare_notice/notice-20251016-1939320807419.json` and siblings) reports zero live/rogue LV/LVCompare processes.
