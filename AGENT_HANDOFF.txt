# Agent Handoff - Compare VI CLI Action

## Context Snapshot
- Installed GitHub CLI (`apt-get install gh`). The binary is now present (`gh --version` → 2.45.0) but
  remains unauthenticated; `gh auth status` still reports "not logged in" because no `GH_TOKEN` was
  provided. `node tools/npm/run-script.mjs priority:sync` therefore continues to fall back to the cached
  metadata for standing issue #134 (latest attempt: 2025-10-16T19:01:53Z, error instructing to run
  `gh auth login`).
- Added Microsoft's repository package and installed PowerShell 7 (`pwsh --version` → 7.5.3).
- Bootstrapped Pester 5.5.0 manually by downloading the PSGallery `.nupkg` and unpacking it under
  `~/.local/share/powershell/Modules/Pester/5.5.0`. `Import-Module Pester -MinimumVersion 5.0.0` now
  succeeds.
- Ran `pwsh -File tools/Detect-RogueLV.ps1 -ResultsDir tests/results -LookBackSeconds 900
  -AppendToStepSummary`; no rogue LabVIEW/LVCompare processes were reported and new
  `tests/results/_lvcompare_notice/notice-*.json` files were recorded for the sweep.
- Attempted `pwsh -File Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -IntegrationMode exclude`. The dispatcher bootstrapped
  correctly with Pester 5.5.0 and began executing 145 files, but the run was manually interrupted after
  roughly four and a half minutes to keep the session moving; no consolidated `pester-summary.json`
  was produced. `_lvcompare_notice` notices from the partial run remain under `tests/results/`.
- Working tree still tracks branch `work`. No topic branch was created and no commits exist yet in this
  session.

## Status & Known Gaps
1. GitHub CLI is installed but unauthenticated. Without `gh auth login` or a `GH_TOKEN`, priority syncs
   cannot reach GitHub for live metadata.
2. Dispatcher coverage remains incomplete: the latest `Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -IntegrationMode exclude`
   run was aborted, so guard telemetry, summaries, and XML/JSON outputs are still missing for the
   current bits.
3. TestStand and CLI-only session artifacts are unchanged placeholders; genuine LabVIEW outputs are
   still outstanding.
4. Issue/PR #134 has not been updated with the restored toolchain details or partial dispatcher attempt.

## Suggested Next Actions
1. Authenticate GitHub CLI (or supply `GH_TOKEN`) and rerun `node tools/npm/run-script.mjs priority:sync`
   so `.agent_priority_cache.json` reflects live issue data.
2. Re-run `pwsh -File Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -IntegrationMode exclude` to completion now that Pester is
   available, capturing the resulting summaries, artifacts, and guard diagnostics.
3. Sync the new dispatcher run, rogue scan output, and any additional telemetry to issue/PR #134.
4. Continue sourcing validated CLI/TestStand artifacts from a LabVIEW-capable Windows host.

## First Actions for the Next Agent
1. Log into GitHub CLI (or export `GH_TOKEN`) and confirm the standing-priority cache refreshes without
   falling back to stale metadata.
2. Complete a dispatcher run (`Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -IntegrationMode exclude`) and archive the outputs
   in `tests/results/`, including summaries and watcher telemetry if available.
3. Propagate the restored toolchain status (gh, pwsh, Pester) and dispatcher findings back to
   issue/PR #134.
4. Maintain the rogue LV sweep cadence using `tools/Detect-RogueLV.ps1` (now operational with pwsh).

## Notes for Next Agent
- `.agent_priority_cache.json` updated at 2025-10-16T19:01:53Z with the error message directing to
  `gh auth login`.
- PowerShell 7.5.3 and Pester 5.5.0 are available under `/opt/microsoft/powershell/7/pwsh` and
  `~/.local/share/powershell/Modules/Pester/5.5.0` respectively.
- `tests/results/_lvcompare_notice/` contains fresh notices from the rogue sweep and the interrupted
  dispatcher attempt.
- `tools/Detect-RogueLV.ps1` wrote `tests/results/_lvcompare_notice/notice-20251016-1911451863535.json`
  (and related files) showing no live or rogue LV/LVCompare processes.
- No new watcher artifacts were produced; `_agent/watcher` remains empty. The dispatcher run was halted
  before summaries were emitted.
