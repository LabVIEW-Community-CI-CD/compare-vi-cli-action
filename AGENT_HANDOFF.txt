# Agent Handoff - Compare VI CLI Action

## Context Snapshot
- Reinstalled GitHub CLI (2.45.0) and re-ran `node tools/npm/run-script.mjs priority:sync`; the cache
  still points to issue #134 because the CLI remains unauthenticated (`gh auth login` / `GH_TOKEN`
  missing). `.agent_priority_cache.json` reflects the latest fallback attempt (2025-10-16T15:32Z).
- Working tree remains on branch `work`; `issue/134-cli-companion` has not been created locally.
- Added the Microsoft package feed, installed PowerShell 7.5.3, and pulled in Pester 5.7.1 so `pwsh`
  and the dispatcher tooling are available in this container.
- Attempted `pwsh -File Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -IntegrationMode exclude`; the dispatcher repeatedly
  relaunched itself after the results guard flagged
  `/tmp/a868d15e-3921-44a2-a345-46ae835883d1/blocked-results.txt`. Terminated the cascading `pwsh`
  tree (`pkill -f Invoke-PesterTests.ps1`); the failure is captured in
  `tests/results/_diagnostics/guard.json`. No Pester summary was produced during this run.
- Placeholder TestStand session data validated again via `node
  dist/tools/schemas/validate-json.js --schema docs/schema/generated/teststand-compare-session.schema.json
  --data tests/results/teststand-session/session-index.json` (succeeds this session).
- Refreshed the quick coverage shim with `node tools/npm/run-script.mjs priority:handoff-tests`,
  updating `tests/results/_agent/handoff/test-summary.json` at 2025-10-16T15:48Z.
- `tools/Detect-RogueLV.ps1 -ResultsDir tests/results -LookBackSeconds 900 -AppendToStepSummary`
  reports no rogue LabVIEW or LVCompare processes (run completed at 2025-10-16T15:49Z).

## Status & Known Gaps
1. GitHub CLI is present but unauthenticated, so standing-priority syncs continue to fall back to the
   cached metadata.
2. Dispatcher coverage is still outstanding. The last attempt hit the results guard loop and produced
   no summaries; investigate `tests/results/_diagnostics/guard.json` (and any lingering
   `/tmp/*/blocked-results.txt` artifacts) before retrying `Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -IntegrationMode
   exclude`.
3. TestStand session artifacts (`tests/results/teststand-session/session-index.json`) and the
   `tests/results/cli-only/` folder are still populated with placeholder dataâ€”real runs from a
   LabVIEW-capable host are required.
4. Issue/PR context for #134 still needs refreshed notes once genuine artifacts and test coverage are
   produced (include CLI metadata, session capsules, validation status).

## Suggested Next Actions
1. Authenticate GitHub CLI (via `gh auth login` or `GH_TOKEN`) and rerun
   `node tools/npm/run-script.mjs priority:sync` so the cache reflects the live standing issue.
2. Inspect `tests/results/_diagnostics/guard.json` and the referenced `/tmp/.../blocked-results.txt`
   path to understand why the dispatcher guard tripped; clean up the blockage so the next
   `Invoke-PesterTests.ps1` run can emit results instead of recursing.
3. Once the guard condition is cleared, rerun `pwsh -File Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -IntegrationMode
   exclude` (and, if time allows, targeted TestStand harness coverage) and capture the resulting
   summaries/artifacts.
4. Generate or copy fresh CLI-only and TestStand session artifacts on a LabVIEW-capable host, then
   re-run the schema validator against the genuine data set.
5. Update issue/PR #134 with notes covering GitHub CLI auth status, dispatcher outcome, schema
   validation, and artifact refresh.

## First Actions for the Next Agent
1. Authenticate GitHub CLI (`gh auth login` or `GH_TOKEN`) and rerun
   `node tools/npm/run-script.mjs priority:sync` so the standing-priority cache reflects the live issue
   metadata.
2. Resolve the dispatcher guard failure (see `tests/results/_diagnostics/guard.json`) and verify no
   lingering defunct `pwsh` processes remain before retrying `pwsh -File Invoke-PesterTests.ps1
   -IntegrationMode exclude`.
3. Fetch or regenerate the missing `tests/results/teststand-session/` and `tests/results/cli-only/`
   directories so schema validation and documentation review can resume with real data. Re-run the
   JSON schema validator once genuine artifacts are in place.
4. Capture the dispatcher and schema results in the appropriate summaries/telemetry, then update
   issue/PR #134 with the refreshed context.

## Notes for Next Agent
- GitHub CLI 2.45.0 and PowerShell 7.5.3 (with Pester 5.7.1) are installed locally; only GitHub
  authentication is missing.
- `tests/results/_agent/handoff/test-summary.json` now records the 2025-10-16T15:48Z
  `priority:handoff-tests` execution.
- `tests/results/_diagnostics/guard.json` documents the dispatcher guard failure that caused the
  aborted `Invoke-PesterTests.ps1` run. The referenced `/tmp/.../blocked-results.txt` file was already
  absent when inspected, so the next agent may need to recreate/clear the guard condition manually.
- No watcher telemetry exists for this session; `_agent/handoff/` watcher assets remain empty.
- `.agent_priority_cache.json` still reflects cached metadata for issue #134 until GitHub CLI is
  authenticated.
- Container image lacks LabVIEW/LVCompare; real artifact generation must happen on a LabVIEW-capable
  Windows environment.
- Schema validation continues to operate on placeholder TestStand session data until genuine output is
  available.
