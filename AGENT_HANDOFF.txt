# Agent Handoff - Compare VI CLI Action

## Context Snapshot
- Running on the Windows runner; PowerShell 7.5.3 is available at `C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe`.
- Pester 5.7.1 is installed (confirmed during the dispatcher run) and ready on the PSModulePath.
- GitHub CLI 2.81.0 lives at `C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe` and is authenticated (`repo`, `workflow`, `gist`, `read:org` scopes).
- `node tools/npm/run-script.mjs priority:sync` reran successfully; `.agent_priority_cache.json` still tracks issue #134 with `lastFetchSource = "live"` (cachedAt 2025-10-19T06:19:58Z, sync executed 2025-10-19T15:37Z).
- Executed `pwsh -File Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -IntegrationMode exclude` (~443 s) with 354/0/0 pass/fail/error and refreshed artifacts under `tests/results/` (`pester-summary.json` timestamp 2025-10-19T15:55:13Z`). LabVIEW exited automatically after the run (no manual intervention needed).
- `pwsh -File tools/Detect-RogueLV.ps1 -ResultsDir tests/results -LookBackSeconds 900 -AppendToStepSummary` ran at 2025-10-19T15:57:41Z; no active LVCompare or LabVIEW processes were detected (new notice under `tests/results/_lvcompare_notice/`).
- Ran `node tools/npm/run-script.mjs priority:handoff-tests` (latest 2025-10-19T15:57:19Z); `tests/results/_agent/handoff/test-summary.json` shows a fresh passing triad for priority, hook, and semver checks.
- Working tree is on branch `develop`; existing uncommitted changes in `.agent_priority_cache.json`, `Invoke-PesterTests.ps1`, `tests/Invoke-PesterTests.Tests.ps1`, `tools/Prime-LVCompare.ps1`, and `tools/RunnerInvoker/RunnerInvoker.psm1`. No commits created this session.

## Status & Known Gaps
1. Dispatcher run completes, but Pester still emits `WARNING: Failed to copy compare report: Cannot overwrite ...\compare-report.html with itself.` Track whether the report duplication logic needs cleanup.
2. Issue/PR #134 has not been updated yet with the latest dispatcher success, rogue sweep, or toolchain confirmations.

## Suggested Next Actions
1. Post a status update to issue/PR #134 covering the successful dispatcher run, live `priority:sync`, and the fresh rogue sweep.
2. Investigate the `compare-report.html` self-copy warning and patch the results copy logic if it persists.
3. Refresh `priority:handoff-tests` when touching priority routing or hook scripts so downstream agents inherit up-to-date summaries.

## First Actions for the Next Agent
1. Run `node tools/npm/run-script.mjs priority:sync` (standard kickoff) and confirm the cache still resolves from live data.
2. If new changes touch tests or dispatcher logic, rerun `pwsh -File Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -IntegrationMode exclude` to keep artifacts current.
3. Review `tests/results/pester-summary.json` and `tests/results/_lvcompare_notice/` before making dispatcher changes so you can spot regressions quickly (Prime-LVCompare now auto-cleans lingering LabVIEW instances on failure paths).

## Notes for Next Agent
- `SUPPRESS_PATTERN_SELFTEST` is set automatically via `tests/_helpers/DispatcherTestHelper.psm1` to avoid the recursion loop fixed in a61202f; do not drop the suppression.
- Pester results: `tests/results/pester-summary.json`, `tests/results/pester-results.xml`, `tests/results/pester-artifacts.json`, `tests/results/pester-summary.txt`.
- Rogue LV notices: `tests/results/_lvcompare_notice/notice-20251019-0805329720.json` and `notice-20251019-0757416403.json`.
- Session capsule: `tests/results/_agent/sessions/session-20251019T154756246Z-a61202f62596.json`.
