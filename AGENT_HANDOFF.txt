# Agent Handoff - Compare VI CLI Action

## Context Snapshot
- Standing priority: issue #127 (per `AGENTS.md` update)
- Current branch: `develop` (CLI enrichment work staged locally; no branch-specific PR yet)
- Recent focus: CLI-only execution path, capture schema enrichment, HTML execution-context updates, and new Pester coverage for CLI metadata.
- Latest changes staged: updated CLI metadata parsing/rendering, README/ENVIRONMENT docs, and new test `tests/CompareReport.CliMetadata.Tests.ps1`.

## Status & Known Gaps
1. **CLI metadata enrichment**
   - `scripts/Capture-LVCompare.ps1`, `tools/Invoke-LVCompare.ps1`, and `tools/TestStand-CompareHarness.ps1` now parse CLI stdout/stderr for `reportType`, `reportPath`, `status`, and `message`, then surface them in the HTML report.
   - Embedded CLI report artefacts are decoded into `cli-images/`, and the summary KV block exposes image counts, sizes, and export paths for downstream tooling.
   - Need a targeted integration run (CLI-only) to capture real output and confirm the HTML shows the new fields on self-hosted runners.

2. **Automation tests**
   - Added `tests/CompareReport.CliMetadata.Tests.ps1` to assert the new data attributes. Ensure it is included in CI (currently only local run). Hook into appropriate Pester suite if we start grouping HTML tests.

3. **Docs refresh**
   - README/ENVIRONMENT mention CLI-only defaults, but release notes / issue #127 comment thread still reference older telemetry focus. Update once validation is complete.

4. **Branch protection cleanup (carry-over)**
   - `develop` may still list `Workflows Lint` as required. Confirm and flip to only `Validate` if that hasnï¿½t been done yet.

## Suggested Next Actions
1. Run a CLI-only harness pass on a self-hosted runner with full LabVIEW CLI installed; verify `environment.cli.*` and HTML summary render as expected (`tests/results/teststand-cli-sanity`).
2. Execute `Invoke-Pester tests/CompareReport.CliMetadata.Tests.ps1` (or `Invoke-Pester -Tag Unit`) to make sure the new test passes in your environment and wire it into any CI job if missing.
3. If the HTML looks good, update issue #127 / release notes with validation screenshots and note the new data attributes.
4. Double-check branch protection (`Validate` only). If still stale, run the gh command below.

## Useful Commands
- CLI-only harness: `pwsh -File tools/TestStand-CompareHarness.ps1 -BaseVi VI1.vi -HeadVi VI2.vi -OutputRoot tests/results/teststand-cli -RenderReport`
- Schema check: `node dist/tools/schemas/validate-json.js --schema docs/schema/generated/lvcompare-capture.schema.json --data tests/results/teststand-cli/compare/lvcompare-capture.json`
- HTML unit test: `Invoke-Pester tests/CompareReport.CliMetadata.Tests.ps1`
- Update protection (if needed):
  ```bash
  gh api repos/LabVIEW-Community-CI-CD/compare-vi-cli-action/branches/develop/protection \
    -X PUT \
    -F required_status_checks.strict=true \
    -F required_status_checks.checks[][context]=Validate
  ```

## Notes for Next Agent
- HTML summary now emits data attributes (`data-cli-*`, `data-base-path`, `data-head-path`). Use these when adding UI tests.
- `tests/CompareReport.CliMetadata.Tests.ps1` assumes `Render-CompareReport.ps1` resolves via relative path from repo root; adjust `$PSScriptRoot` if you move the test.
- If you observe CLI runs without reportType/status, capture stdout and share so we can expand the regexes.
