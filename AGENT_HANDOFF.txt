# Agent Handoff - Compare VI CLI Action

## Context Snapshot
- Running on the Windows runner; PowerShell 7.5.3 is available at `C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe`.
- Pester 5.7.1 is preinstalled and still on the PSModulePath.
- GitHub CLI 2.81.0 resides at `C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe` with valid `repo`, `workflow`, `gist`, `read:org` scopes.
- `node tools/npm/run-script.mjs priority:sync` ran at 2025-10-22T18:25Z; `.agent_priority_cache.json` now tracks standing issue #285 (`lastFetchSource = "live"`, digest aligned with `tests/results/_agent/issue/285.json`).
- Latest `tools/Print-AgentHandoff.ps1 -ApplyToggles -AutoTrim` execution (2025-10-22T18:39Z) confirmed the watcher is idle, reapplied LabVIEW safety toggles, and wrote session capsule `tests/results/_agent/sessions/session-20251022T183930471Z-8dd088cf59d9.json`.
- `pwsh -File tools/Detect-RogueLV.ps1 -ResultsDir tests/results -LookBackSeconds 900 -AppendToStepSummary` executed at 2025-10-22T18:26Z; no rogue LVCompare/LabVIEW processes detected (JSON emitted to console only).
- `node tools/npm/run-script.mjs priority:handoff-tests` last ran 2025-10-22T03:23Z; cached results remain under `tests/results/_agent/handoff/test-summary.json`.
- Working tree on `issue/285-feature-branch-policy` (tracking origin); only documentation edits staged so far.

## Status & Known Gaps
1. Drafted `docs/knowledgebase/FEATURE_BRANCH_POLICY.md` and linked it from the Developer Guide; the write-up still needs SME review plus a sanity check that the recorded merge queue parameters match GitHubâ€™s current ruleset.
2. `docs/documentation-manifest.json` now lists the new knowledge base article. `node tools/npm/run-script.mjs lint:md` passed on 2025-10-22; rerun after any follow-up edits.
3. `tools/priority/policy.json` now tracks the `main` merge-queue ruleset; keep it in sync if GitHub updates queue parameters.
4. Cached release artifacts (`tests/results/_agent/release/release-v0.5.2-rc1-*.json`) are unchanged but still reference PR #279; keep them in mind if the release thread reopens.

## Suggested Next Actions
1. Re-run `node tools/npm/run-script.mjs lint:md` (and optionally `hooks:multi`) after making additional documentation edits.
2. Verify the merge queue parameters by requerying `gh api repos/LabVIEW-Community-CI-CD/compare-vi-cli-action/rulesets/8614140` and update the doc if GitHub adjusts defaults.
3. Re-run `node tools/npm/run-script.mjs priority:policy` after any policy tweaks to confirm the merge-queue expectations remain aligned.

## First Actions for the Next Agent
1. Run `node tools/npm/run-script.mjs priority:sync` to refresh the standing-priority snapshot for #285.
2. Review `docs/knowledgebase/FEATURE_BRANCH_POLICY.md` for accuracy and tighten wording if SME feedback arrives.
3. Execute `node tools/npm/run-script.mjs lint:md` before pushing to ensure markdownlint stays green.
4. Check `tests/results/_agent/issue/router.json` to keep the priority router aligned once additional tasks queue up.

## Notes for Next Agent
- `SUPPRESS_PATTERN_SELFTEST` remains enforced via `tests/_helpers/DispatcherTestHelper.psm1`; leave it enabled to avoid recursion loops.
- Pester artifacts live under `tests/results/` (`pester-summary.json`, `pester-results.xml`, `pester-artifacts.json`, `pester-summary.txt`).
- Rogue LV notices: most recent is `tests/results/_lvcompare_notice/notice-20251021-0521137873.json`; earlier notices from 2025-10-20 remain for history.
- Latest session capsule: `tests/results/_agent/sessions/session-20251022T183930471Z-8dd088cf59d9.json`.

## Manual LabVIEW Recovery (when LV refuses to exit)
1. Run `pwsh -File tools/Detect-RogueLV.ps1 -ResultsDir tests/results -LookBackSeconds 900` to list live LVCompare/LabVIEW PIDs.
2. Attempt graceful shutdown: `pwsh -File tools/Close-LabVIEW.ps1`.
3. If PIDs remain, issue `Stop-Process -Id <pid> -Force` for each rogue entry (LVCompare first, then LabVIEW). Capture the console log for the issue thread.
4. Re-run `tools/Detect-RogueLV.ps1 -FailOnRogue` to confirm cleanup; escalate in #285 if the second sweep still reports live processes.
