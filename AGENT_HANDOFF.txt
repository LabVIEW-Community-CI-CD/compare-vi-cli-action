# Agent Handoff - Compare VI CLI Action

## Context Snapshot
- Running on the Windows runner; PowerShell 7.5.3 is available at `C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe`.
- Pester 5.7.1 remains on the PSModulePath.
- GitHub CLI 2.81.0 is available with `repo`, `workflow`, `gist`, and `read:org` scopes.
- `node tools/npm/run-script.mjs priority:sync` ran at 2025-10-22T22:01Z; `.agent_priority_cache.json` now tracks standing issue #293 (`lastFetchSource = "live"`, digest aligned with `tests/results/_agent/issue/293.json`).
- Latest `tools/Print-AgentHandoff.ps1 -ApplyToggles -AutoTrim` execution (2025-10-22T19:43Z) confirmed the watcher is idle, re-applied LabVIEW safety toggles, and wrote session capsule `tests/results/_agent/sessions/session-20251022T194354048Z-058a25d675fd.json`.
- `pwsh -File tools/Detect-RogueLV.ps1 -ResultsDir tests/results -LookBackSeconds 900 -AppendToStepSummary` executed at 2025-10-22T19:32Z; no rogue LVCompare/LabVIEW processes detected.
- `node tools/npm/run-script.mjs priority:handoff-tests` last ran 2025-10-22T03:23Z; cached results remain under `tests/results/_agent/handoff/test-summary.json`.
- Working tree on `issue/293-validate-push` (tracking upstream); latest commit `2897467` ("feat: auto-publish validate refs (#293)") synced locally.

## Status & Known Gaps
1. `tools/priority/dispatch-validate.mjs` now supports `--push-missing` / `--force-push-ok`; `npm run priority:test` passed (40 tests, ~6.3s) after the update.
2. Validate run 18730978798 (`priority:validate -- --ref issue/293-validate-push --push-missing --allow-fork --force-push-ok`, head `2897467`) completed **success** at 2025-10-22T22:00Z; earlier runs 18730963960 / 18730940250 auto-cancelled after the superseding dispatch.
3. PR #294 (“feat: auto-publish validate refs (#293)”) is open against `develop`; the latest Validate jobs (`lint`, `fixtures`, `session-index`, `semver`, hook parity matrix) all report success.
4. `docs/knowledgebase/FEATURE_BRANCH_POLICY.md` documents the auto-publish flag; loop SMEs for tone/accuracy once tests are green.
5. Cached release artifacts (`tests/results/_agent/release/release-v0.5.2-rc1-*.json`) still reference PR #279; no action required unless the release thread reopens.

## Suggested Next Actions
1. Monitor PR #294 until Validate and required sub-jobs (`lint`, `fixtures`, `session-index`) stay green; re-dispatch `priority:validate` with `--push-missing`/`--force-push-ok` only if a follow-up commit lands.
2. Coordinate SME feedback on the doc updates once reviewers are available; capture their sign-off in the PR.
3. Kick off `tools/PrePush-Checks.ps1` and `node tools/npm/run-script.mjs hooks:multi` before any further workflow-touching commits to keep hook telemetry current.

## First Actions for the Next Agent
1. Run `node tools/npm/run-script.mjs priority:sync` to refresh the standing-priority snapshot (issue #293).
2. Execute `npm run priority:test` after follow-up edits so the new auto-push flows stay covered.
3. Watch `gh pr checks 294` (and `gh run view 18730978798 --log`) to ensure the PR summary stays accurate; only re-dispatch with `--push-missing`/`--force-push-ok` if new commits land.
4. Check `tests/results/_agent/issue/router.json` for updated priority actions once the router refreshes.

## Notes for Next Agent
- `SUPPRESS_PATTERN_SELFTEST` remains enforced via `tests/_helpers/DispatcherTestHelper.psm1`; leave it enabled to avoid recursion loops.
- Pester artifacts live under `tests/results/` (`pester-summary.json`, `pester-results.xml`, `pester-artifacts.json`, `pester-summary.txt`).
- Rogue LV notices: most recent is `tests/results/_lvcompare_notice/notice-20251021-0521137873.json`; earlier notices (2025-10-20) retained for history.
- Latest session capsule: `tests/results/_agent/sessions/session-20251022T194354048Z-058a25d675fd.json`.
- `priority:validate` now accepts `--push-missing` / `--force-push-ok`; combine with `--allow-fork` (or set the env toggles) when running from a fork so the helper can publish the branch before dispatching CI.

## Manual LabVIEW Recovery (when LV refuses to exit)
1. Run `pwsh -File tools/Detect-RogueLV.ps1 -ResultsDir tests/results -LookBackSeconds 900` to list live LVCompare/LabVIEW PIDs.
2. Attempt graceful shutdown: `pwsh -File tools/Close-LabVIEW.ps1`.
3. If PIDs remain, issue `Stop-Process -Id <pid> -Force` for each rogue entry (LVCompare first, then LabVIEW). Capture the console output for the issue thread.
4. Re-run `tools/Detect-RogueLV.ps1 -FailOnRogue` to confirm cleanup; escalate in #293 if rogues persist.
