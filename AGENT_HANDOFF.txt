Progress: history suite now writes one aggregate manifest (`vi-compare/history-suite@v1`) plus per-mode manifests. `tools/Compare-VIHistory.ps1` no longer runs per-mode loops separately, and the manual workflow consumes the suite output instead of stitching manifests on its own.

Tests: 11/11 passing via `./Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -TestsPath tests/CompareVI.History.Tests.ps1 -IntegrationMode include`.

Next session:
  1) Confirm downstream tooling that digests the workflow artifacts (dashboards, metrics jobs) reads `mode-manifests-json` successfully.
  2) Once the branch lands on `develop`, rerun `vi-compare-refs.yml` to ensure artifact uploads and diff scanning behave with the new suite manifests.
