# Agent Handoff - Compare VI CLI Action

## Context Snapshot
- Reinstalled GitHub CLI 2.45.0 via apt; the binary is available but still unauthenticated (`gh auth
  status` continues to report "not logged in" without a `GH_TOKEN`). Fresh
  `node tools/npm/run-script.mjs priority:sync` attempts therefore fall back to cached metadata for
  issue #134 and emit the `gh auth login` guidance.
- Added Microsoft's package feed, installed PowerShell 7.5.3, and manually staged Pester 5.5.0 by
  unpacking the PSGallery `.nupkg` into `~/.local/share/powershell/Modules/Pester/5.5.0`. Importing the
  module now succeeds and `Get-Module Pester` reports version 5.5.0.
- Ran `pwsh -File tools/Detect-RogueLV.ps1 -ResultsDir tests/results -LookBackSeconds 900
  -AppendToStepSummary`; no rogue LabVIEW/LVCompare processes were detected and a fresh batch of
  `tests/results/_lvcompare_notice/notice-*.json` files was emitted.
- Kicked off `pwsh -File Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -IntegrationMode exclude` (logging to `/tmp/pester.log`).
  The dispatcher launched successfully, but after ~10 minutes it began spawning nested `pwsh`
  processes without producing `pester-summary.json`; the guard dropped
  `tests/results/_diagnostics/guard.json` complaining that the results path resolved to a file. The
  process tree was terminated to keep the workspace responsive.
- Ran `node tools/npm/run-script.mjs priority:handoff-tests`; the quick regression bundle completed and
  updated `tests/results/_agent/handoff/test-summary.json`.
- Working tree remains on branch `work`; no commits have been created this session.

## Status & Known Gaps
1. GitHub CLI is present but unauthenticated; priority syncs still fail without a token, leaving
   `.agent_priority_cache.json` on cached data.
2. `Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -IntegrationMode exclude` did not finish cleanly. The guard recorded
   `tests/results/_diagnostics/guard.json` and no `pester-summary.json`/NUnit output was produced before
   the run was terminated.
3. The dispatcher watchdog left several defunct `pwsh` processes behind when interrupted. Fresh runs
   should start from a clean shell and may need the diagnostics guard cleared.
4. Issue/PR #134 still needs an update describing the restored toolchain, rogue sweep, and dispatcher
   findings.

## Suggested Next Actions
1. Authenticate GitHub CLI (or export `GH_TOKEN`) and rerun `priority:sync` so the standing-priority
   cache refreshes against live data.
2. Investigate the dispatcher guard (see `tests/results/_diagnostics/guard.json` and `/tmp/pester.log`),
   clear any stale artifacts, and rerun `Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -IntegrationMode exclude` to completion.
3. Capture the rerun’s summaries (JSON, XML, leak reports, watcher telemetry) and share the findings—
   along with the restored toolchain status—in issue/PR #134.
4. Maintain the rogue LV sweep cadence with `tools/Detect-RogueLV.ps1` and continue sourcing
   platform-specific artifacts as needed.

## First Actions for the Next Agent
1. Provide GitHub credentials (`gh auth login` or `GH_TOKEN`) and verify `priority:sync` succeeds.
2. Reset the dispatcher guard state, launch `Invoke-PesterTests.ps1 -IntegrationMode exclude`, and let
   it complete so `tests/results/pester-summary.json` and related artifacts materialise.
3. Post an update to issue/PR #134 covering the toolchain restoration, rogue sweep outcome, and
   dispatcher rerun status.
4. Continue the rogue LV sweep cadence (`tools/Detect-RogueLV.ps1`) now that PowerShell and Pester are
   available locally.

## Notes for Next Agent
- `gh --version` reports 2.45.0, but `gh auth status` still prompts for `gh auth login`; the latest
  `priority:sync` attempt failed with the same guidance.
- PowerShell 7.5.3 lives at `/opt/microsoft/powershell/7/pwsh`; Pester 5.5.0 is unpacked under
  `~/.local/share/powershell/Modules/Pester/5.5.0` and loads successfully.
- Rogue sweep notices were written under `tests/results/_lvcompare_notice/` after the
  `tools/Detect-RogueLV.ps1` run; no LVCompare/LabVIEW processes were detected.
- The dispatcher guard left `tests/results/_diagnostics/guard.json` referencing a temporary
  `blocked-results.txt`. Inspect `/tmp/pester.log` and the guard file before retrying the dispatcher.
- `tests/results/_agent/handoff/watcher-telemetry.json` now records the watcher state (`stopped`) from
  this session’s telemetry sweep.
