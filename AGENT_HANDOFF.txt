Current Status

LVCompare Required - LVCompare remains the required comparator. The LabVIEW CLI compare path is
opt-in via LVCI_COMPARE_MODE. The non-required cli-compare.yml deploys reports under
tests/results/compare-cli. Close-LabVIEW is now the shared entry point and auto-selects between
g-cli and labview-cli.

Optional Utilities

g-cli Availability - gcli-preflight.yml checks runner readiness for g-cli.
Bespoke g-cli - tools/Invoke-GCli.ps1 can run any targeted g-cli command when needed.
LVCompare x64-only - Set LVCI_ONLY_X64=1 to ignore any x86 LVCompare paths; workflows updated to export this for preflight and CLI compare.
CLI NUnit Gate - tools/Assert-NUnitSuccess.ps1 enforces that tests/results/compare-cli/results-nunit.xml exists and reports a passing run; the CLI workflow now fails if the NUnit report shows failures or is missing.

Heads-Up

Scaffolded Diff Detection - If cli-compare.yml has not been run since the latest changes, it may
still be using the scaffolded diff detection (diffUnknown). Run cli-compare.yml to refresh and
verify expected report formats and fields.

Next-Agent Plan (LabVIEW CLI compare artifacts)

Inventory Outputs – Run cli-compare.yml locally/on the self-hosted runner to confirm current LabVIEW CLI report files (tests/results/compare-cli/*, compare-exec.json). Capture sample artifacts for reference.
Schema Alignment – Extend compare-exec/v1 contract (if needed) to record reportPath, mode, and diffUnknown. Update schema docs/tests so LVCompare & LabVIEW CLI paths emit consistent fields.
Report Parsing – Implement parsers for XML/HTML/TXT/DOCX (start with XML) to surface diff metadata (e.g., files, nodes) in compare-exec.json or a new compare-report.json. Provide fail-safe reason codes when parsing fails.
Step Summary/Artifacts – Add a summary block in cli-compare.yml and the action composite step highlighting report format, path, and diff status. Upload the raw report (and optional JSON summary) via Upload CLI compare artifacts.
Docs & Usage – Update README/USAGE_GUIDE with how to access CLI reports, describe LVCI_CLI_FORMAT, and mention new artifact names. Add troubleshooting notes (e.g., missing report, diffUnknown).
CI Validation – Enhance cli-compare.yml to fail when the report is missing or unparseable (unless explicitly allowed). Consider label-gated PR check using CLI compare to keep it optional but visible.
